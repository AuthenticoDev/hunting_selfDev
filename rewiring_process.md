*Origin*
I felt like the hunting instinct was being wasted. A capacity refined over millions of years, and what did I use it for? Going to the market and getting a cheap deal? 
Perhaps I'd go with a gun and shoot some innocent creature, without any real reason (it's like disrepecting the hunting instinct).

*Rechanneling*
So, I figured maybe I could rechannel it; recycling the instinct itself, utilizing a few simple techniques.
I tried it, and it worked wonders, never stopped hunting since - it is very useful and nourishing too; incredibly gratifying.

Basically it's about rewiring the brain a bit. You got a hunting instinct, and it channels certain demand and needs. 
- Nourishment
- Ecosystem value
- Real value (not fake "pretending to create value but relying on so much oppression that any gain is negated by the intense minus that accompanies")
- Avoiding overgrowth, imbalance and excess populations (disease, sickness, ails, weakness etc. = easy fulfillment = attracts predators = rebalances the ecosystem = predators move on or die = growth = over-consumption = .. - you get it) 

So I theorized that if I could give these needs a different but similar fulfillment pathway, the hunting instinct would "accept" the rewiring.

I wondered what might align; and figured there were things causing immense negative things.
- Ecosystem value
- Canceling out intense costs (real value)
- Balance
- Nourishment (learning, skill, growth, awareness, applicable knowledge, etc.)

*Actively performing the rewiring*
The way to perform the rewiring is simple: Repetition.
I just began tracing the vast drains, evaluating these and then found some way to process it (grew aware of it, talked about it - shaped awareness and desire to mitigate). 
Did that over and over again, after some days or weeks (don't remmeber) it was ingrained and it became self-reinforcing.f

*Post-story*
It was part of a open-source self-development project. 
Sadly the world was incredibly busy with denying, suppressing and harming me, so it's first now (2025) I'm able to bring it to the world.
Did try sharing it along the way, but largely it seemed to be ignored.
